First get your bread and put the required amount of pizza sauce on it until the sauce covers the bread. Then put your desired amount of cheese on the bread. Once you finish that add your favorite toppings and top it off with a bit of more cheese. Once you complete all of these steps put it in your oven or your pan until it is crispy/golden brown. Lastly take the pizza out of the oven or off the pan and enjoy.
